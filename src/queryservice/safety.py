"""The guard layer.

Injection is not stopped by one trick, so this module is four independent ones. Any one
of them failing should leave the other three standing:

1. **Values are bound, never formatted.** Every user-supplied *value* reaches DuckDB as a
   prepared-statement parameter.
2. **Identifiers are allowlisted.** A column or table name cannot be bound as a parameter,
   so the only dynamic identifiers permitted are ones the query itself declares, and the
   supplied value must be one of that declared set -- an equality check against a fixed
   list, not a regex on the input.
3. **One statement, and it must read.** ``duckdb.extract_statements`` parses the SQL and
   we reject anything that is not exactly one ``SELECT``/``WITH``. This kills stacked
   queries and comment-terminated payloads at the parser rather than with string matching.
4. **The connection is read-only and the result is capped.** Even a payload that somehow
   reached the engine cannot write, and no query can pull an unbounded result set.

Layer 3 is the one worth explaining in an interview: blocklisting keywords like ``DROP``
is a losing game, but asking the database's own parser "how many statements is this, and
what kind" is not.
